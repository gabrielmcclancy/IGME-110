            One of the most polarizing points of discussion between Call of Duty fans and Call of Duty naysayers is the campaign. Modern Warfare 2's campaign in particular seems to divide people the most.        </p2>

            As mentioned in the essay, Call of Duty 4's campaign wanted to empower the player and allow them to live a power fantasy.

            I will allow you to be the judge by reading my essay as well as the blog post above and deciding which side seems more reasonable.        </p2>
