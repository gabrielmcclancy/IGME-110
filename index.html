            Hi, I'm Gabe Maciejaszek! I'm a Year One student at RIT, and I'm majoring in Game Design and Development.
            Before RIT, though, I spent my entire life back home at Queens, New York. I know a lot of people are
            fascinated by the bright lights and such in the Big Apple, but personally, I grew tired of it as I got older.
            So, I began to search for a college far from home, but not too far. Obviously, the focus on game development
            this school offers sold me on it almost instantly, and I have to say I'm really happy I came here! Hopefully
            I feel the same way four years from today!

        </p2>

            Growing up, I was absolutely in love with Playstation 2 games. In particular, I had a fondness for the
            platformer genre. Games like Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, and Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus
            made my imagination run wild. I became lost in these digital worlds every time I turned on the console,
            and in a way that's hard to explain, these games have shaped me into who I am. Because of this, I hold the
            people that made these games in high regard. I can only hope that one day I can inspire people the same way
            I was inspired as a kid.

            Here's a screenshot from Ratchet and Clank, one of my favorite games growing up.

            Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
            in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
            folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
            to open your own folder.
            You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
            sample project.

        <p>
            I won't lie to you; college has been tough on me at times. As someone who has never even taken a
            programming class prior, the workload here has hit me like a ton of bricks. Thankfully, my friends
            from back home have been with me every step of the way, and I'm grateful to be able to depend on them
            whenever I'm in a pinch or just need morale support.

            I even went so far as to include Eoin in one of my class assignments! He is now immortalized.
